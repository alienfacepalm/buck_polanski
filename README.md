# Buck's Portfolio

> This entire site was built using CLI commands and AI, specifically Cursor IDE with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Not a single line of code was edited by hand. All images were generated using <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/images/create" target="_blank">Microsoft Copilot Image Creator</a> and edited with Microsoft Designer.
