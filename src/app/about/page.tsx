          Buck Polanski is a legendary adventurer, quantum physicist, and gourmet chef who has redefined what it means to be a modern-day Renaissance person.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Born to Czech parents in a small mountain town, Buck discovered his passion for science while simultaneously becoming a world-class wakeboarder. By age 25, he had already published groundbreaking research on quantum entanglement while setting multiple wakeboarding records across international competitions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When not revolutionizing our understanding of particle physics or performing aerial wakeboarding tricks, Buck runs a critically acclaimed pop-up restaurant that fuses molecular gastronomy with traditional Czech cuisine. His signature dish, "Quantum Knedl√≠ky," has been featured in numerous international culinary magazines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, Buck splits his time between his research lab in Switzerland, various wakeboarding competitions, and teaching underprivileged youth how to code, wakeboard, and cook.
